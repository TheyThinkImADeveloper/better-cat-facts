Murderpaws, a female tabby, won gold at the 1917 Des Moines Winter Olympics in the Men's 300m Butterfly event. Tabbys have gone on to dominate all swimming events at subsequent olympics.
In 1842, a cat named Grumble Guts travelled from Antigua to Barbados in a raft crafted only of the bodies of mice he had killed.
